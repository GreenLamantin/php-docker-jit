PHP docker image with experimental jit support
===

This code is a helper to try out the php with experimental jit support. It was written as a pet project inspired by
the [tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/dr4goonis/status/806817526097346560) that states 54% performance improvement.

**NOT PRODUCTION READY** this branch is still experimental and far from stability. Use it on your own risk

Code is a copy-paste of [docker/php](https://github.com/docker-library/php) builder with slight additions to be able to compile
git-based version of php.
